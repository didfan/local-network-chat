first start chatServer and then chatUser where you will need to enter the ip and the port
default ip: 127.0.0.1
default port: 8080

If you want to change the server ip or port go to the file chatServer.c,
these parameters will be declared at the top. 
Then recompile the project (if you are using the windows version you will need to plug in the ws2_32 library)
